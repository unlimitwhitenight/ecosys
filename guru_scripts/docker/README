- Configure Docker Desktop using at least 2 cores, and 10G memory. Recommend 4 cores, 16G memory
click Dock Desktop icon, click Preferences...>>Advance menu, drag CPU and Memory slide to the desired confi.
quit and restart docker desktop

Prepare shared data drive on your host with docker container
=============================================================
#Open a shell on your host machine 
cd ~/

#below is the folder to share between your host machine and docker container.
mkdir data
chmod 777 data

# You can put files under ~/data, it will be visible in /home/tigergraph/tigergraph/loadingData, which is defined by "-v ~/data:/home/tigergraph/tigergraph/loadingData
" in the docker command
# Vice versa, anything you put under /home/tigergraph/tigergraph/loadingData within the container, will be visible on your host machchine ~/data folder. 

Since our dev edition does not support backup/restore data, you can persist your data (raw file, gsql script etc.)  on the data volume
After upgrading Dev version, you can start a new container using the same data volume. 

Pull Pre-built TigerGraph Docker Image and Run it as a Deamon
=====================================================
One command pull docker image and bind all ports for first time user from TigerGraph  docker registry. This image will start as a daemon, so user can ssh to it. 

#rm old version, only do this step if you upgrade your docker  image
docker rmi -f docker.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-dev:latest > /dev/null 2>&1

#stop and remove existing container only if an old version is being used
docker container ls | grep tigergraph_dev
docker stop tigergraph_dev
docker rm tigergraph_dev

#pull the tigergraph docker image and run it as a daemon, change the ports accordingly if there is a conflict
docker run -d -p 14022:22 -p 9000:9000 -p 14240:14240 --name tigergraph_dev --ulimit nofile=1000000:1000000 -v ~/data:/home/tigergraph/tigergraph/loadingData -t docker.tigergraph.com/tigergraph-dev:latest
#note: if you are using windows, change the above ~/data to something using windows file system convention, e.g. c:\data

#verify that container is running
docker ps | grep tigergraph_dev

#get ip address of the running container
docker inspect tigergraph_dev | grep IPAddress

#Optional: stop/start container
docker container stop tigergraph_dev
docker container start tigergraph_dev
